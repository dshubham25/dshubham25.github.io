In this blog post I am going to write about Computer Networks topics and some of the frequently ask questions on Computer Networks.

### What is Computer Networks?

Computer Networks is defined as the connection of computer devices that can exchange the data and share resources with each other. These connections with proper protocols is called communication.
Protocol helps in understanding the messages.

When a process communicates with another process in the same machine it is called **inter-process communication (IPC)**.

#### TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP Model is defined as the practical version of the OSI model, it was built by ARPANET. TCP/IP model supports Client to Server or Peer to Peer connection. There are 4 layers of the TCP/IP Model and these are:
1. Application Layer
2. Transport Layer
3. Internet Layer
4. Network Acess Layer
